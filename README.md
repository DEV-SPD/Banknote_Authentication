# Banknote_Authentication
This project aims to detect fake bank notes.

I took dataset from UCI Repository & it contains Features such as wavelet variance, wavelet skewness, wavelet kurtosis, and image entropy are extracted from the images.

Used Gradient Boosting Classifer Algorithm to build an 99.275 percent accurate machine learning model.

Further, I used streamlit to create an UI and then integrated model with this UI for making predictions.
